# Via

 **Via** is a lightweight, composable Fetch wrapper designed for building robust, type-safe API clients in TypeScript.

It provides a clean separation between runtime networking concerns and compile-time API contracts, enabling excellent developer experience without locking you into a specific backend or schema format.

Via supports:

* Typed REST clients (OpenAPI or custom registries)
* Untyped / raw fetch usage when contracts are unavailable
* Incremental adoption (from simple fetch wrapper to full SDK)
* Strong testability and predictable behavior

Via is framework-agnostic and intended to be used in browsers, Node.js, and edge runtimes.
